      <p> 
          In starting Dynamic Web Development 1, I didn't know what I would expect throughtout this course excluding coding. 
          In my first week of classes for Web Dev, the lecturer was cool and didn't just throw work onto the students like other lectures which was really good to see. 
          With the movement of the classes and tutorials overtime, I've learn alot about web developement. <img id="first_paragraph_image" src ="javier.JPG" alt="Javier Stewart" />

      <p> <span style="width:80%;padding-top:2rem;">
          Previously, I didn't do much coding for HTML or CSS and this class has really started things for me in the web development side of life. 
          We started JS which is something different but somewhat similar to Java which I am happy for. </span></p>

           <span style="padding:2rem;">Since starting Computer Science at The University of the West Indies, it has been a challenge in trying to always be on top of my work 
           until I've started most work long before they due. I recently received a second lab for my Dynamic Web Development class and even with
           the fact that I have to be searching up many of the things because I am unaware of what to do. It is a great point to always start work early 
           so I can ask the lecturer on Friday during the Lab Session. </span>
        </p>
        <p> <span style="padding-right:2rem;padding-top:2rem;">On the other hand, sometimes work seems a bit pressuring by the amount of courses so some days are used for resting the mind. 
          Many persons ignore this factor and normally doing alot more bad than good and I do not plan to fall in that category. </span></p>
